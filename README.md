# Boilerplate file starter for go

When making a new file in `go` I'm too lazy to type

```
package package

import (
    "fmt"
)
      
func func() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

so I created a snippet `bp` to help me write that BoilerPlate code(and fill in package and func values and put my cursor at the first line of main function).
